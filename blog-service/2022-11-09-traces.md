We've updated Tracing dashboards with native support for monitoring OT deployment.environment standard tag

OT deployment.environment is a nice way of slicing APM data between environments (e.g. dev vs prod). It is already supported in tracing metrics and available for custom queries and dashboards. We wanted to follow up with support for it in pout of the box dashboards.

* New Explore view: APM: Environment view
* ?? views renamed to APM: Service view and APM: Application view
Each of above views get new hierarchy level with deployment.environment
* New dashboards [... across environments and ... within environment] showing data sliced or filtered for/between recognized environments
* **Environment** as new entity in Entity Inspector
* **Environment** filter added to all drill-down views
